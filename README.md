First part: em-convex [arXiv:1807.02058](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02058). 

This will not be continued here, for the moment. Some of the files have been used in the first part.

This repository contains work for the EM (emergent algebras) term rewrite system. It will have several parts, (first part is em-convex) and it will be built progresively, from a lambda calculus style formalism to a machine for computing space (and physics). 

The goal of the articles  is to write a clear description of the formalism and eventually to complement [chemlambda](https://github.com/chorasimilarity/chemlambda-gui/blob/gh-pages/dynamic/README.md). 

You are welcome to collaborate, review, etc, either here, or [contact me directly](https://mbuliga.github.io/) or at the [chorasimilarity blog](https://chorasimilarity.wordpress.com/about/)
