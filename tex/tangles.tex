\section{Decorated tangles}

Recall that to any knot diagram is associated a quandle (which is an invariant, in the sense that the same quandle is associated to any other knot diagram obtained from a sequence of applications of R1, R1, R2 knot theory Reidemeister rewrites). We may consider knot diagrams with the crossings decorated with elements from a set $\Upsilon$, as explained in sections 3.3, 3.4 \cite{buligachora}.
